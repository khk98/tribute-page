            <h3><b>Casey's Youtube channel<b></h3>
                <p class="y">
                    In February 2010, Casey Neistat created a self-titled channel on YouTube. His first upload was regarding the emergency brake cords on train cars. He then released a 6-minute short film related to the internet site Chatroulette. After this, he released a video criticizing New York City Police Department for ticketing cyclists in the New York City. From March 2015 onward, Neistat began to post vlogs daily. His vlog titled ‘The Vice President, Outer Space & the Baby’ was released in May 2015. The next year, in January 2016, Neistat, along with his fellow mates shot a video on the empty streets of the New York City. This video titled ‘Snowboarding with the NYPD’ depicted Neistat being pulled on a rope on the streets. This 2-minute, 41-second video vent viral and as a result of this, Neistat gained a lot of publicity. Later on, in September 2016, the YouTuber published a vlog regarding his experience in Emirates' first class seat. This video again gained much attention from the public. The journey of vlogs continued and before long his subscriber count sky-rocketed to a few millions.

                <h3><b>Casey's Journey<b></h3>
                <p class="y">
                    New York-based filmmaker Casey Neistat has made short films for Nike and his keynote address today at SXSW might be summarized best by the company’s slogan: Just Do It.
Thanks to the Internet and technology, Neistat said, the distribution model has evaporated and “all you need is the internet connection” to “reach the entire world.”

Neistat told the inspirational story of how he came to become a filmmaking — by way of being a teen father on welfare living in a trailer and working as a dish washer.

When the self-taught filmmaker started to make movies with a friend (“He had a computer. I had a camera.”), Neistat discovered his passion. “It was the most exhilarating feeling in the world,” he said. “We had something we made that was this movie. It was shit. It was unwatchable, but it was fun.”

After attaining commercial success with an HBO show (“The Neistat Brothers”) and producing a successful indie film (“Daddy Longlegs”), Neistat realized he missed the basics of telling stories and, in 2010, became a “YouTube filmmaker” before it was cool. Now his YouTube films get millions of hits and he makes short films for brands — and occasionally breaks the rules.

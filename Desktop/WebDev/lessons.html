            <h2>Lessons Learnt from Casey!</h2>  
<p>

    <br>
1. Give zero fucks what people think.<br>
    <hr>
2. Always ask yourself: “Am I living the life that I want?” Constantly evaluate where you are in life to make sure you are heading towards the direction you want.<br><hr>
3. “Without a goal you can’t score” is an awesome quote because it is true.<br><hr>
4. Your biggest success in life can be your biggest failure at the same time.<br><hr>
5. It’s ok to break up and get back together.<br><hr>
6. You can get back together more than once.<br><hr>
7. Running a marathon without proper training results in a beatdown.<br><hr>
8. Find your passion in life. When you’ve found out what that is — spend the rest of your life working on your passion.<br><hr>
9. Decide what you think are the most important things in life. Then, prioritize your life according to those things.<br><hr>
10. Take selfies with strangers.<br><hr>
11. Go to bed when you’ve finished work — not earlier.<br><hr>
12. Success is not a destination.<br><hr>
13. Commit to your commitments.<br><hr>
14. When you get bullied, success is the best revenge. Always remember: the kids who bully you are losers, and will remain losers.<br><hr>
15. You never ‘make’ it. There is no end goal in life so you should enjoy the journey.<br><hr>
16. Don’t get bored. Ever.<br><hr>
17. Weekends are NOT for shopping.<br><hr>
18. Keep a backlog of things you want or have to do. When you run out of tasks, pick one from your backlog.<br><hr>
19. Get out of the city every weekend.<br><hr>
20. Family and work are the most important things in life.<br><hr>
21. Never get comfortable.<br><hr>
22. If you want to get back together — surprise your girlfriend by replacing the AC unit in her apartment.<br><hr>
23. Don’t be a slave to praise.<br><hr>
24. Run. Every day.<br><hr>
25. Do more work.<br><hr>
26. Haters are losers.<br><hr>
27. When you give a gift to your girlfriend or wife, you need to take three factors into consideration. First, your gift needs to generate a smile plus a swoon. Second, you want a shock and awe response. Third, you really have to surprise her. Only when you have all three factors right, you will get the highest appreciation that you can receive: she says, “good job.”<br><hr>
28. Bring a skateboard when you travel.<br><hr>
29. Film your life — you are the director, actor, producer.<br><hr>
30. Be nice to people. It’s not cool when people are unfriendly.<br><hr>
31. Bad times are not here to stay. Everything will pass, so will bad times.<br><hr>
32. Challenge everything in life. Never accept the norm.<br><hr>
33. Don’t try to fit it — you will be unhappy when you try to be something you are not.<br><hr>

Casey has accomplished many things in his life. One of his biggest accomplishments is that he scrubbed pans for 5 years in a seafood restaurant. Think about it: 5 years is a long time.<br><hr>

Most people are looking for instant results with everything in life — with jobs, relationships, health, money, learning skills.<br><hr>

They end up hopping from job to job, and passion to passion. When you never stick with one thing, you never become good at anything.<br><hr>

Casey picked making films and now, 15 years later, he has mastered storytelling to a point that he has millions of views on his YouTube channel.
<br><hr>
Finally, the biggest lesson I’ve learned from Casey is that life is a constant fight — you should love the struggle.
